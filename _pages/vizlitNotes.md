I love making interactive data visualizations on the web for topics I find interesting. My brother [Adam Callister](https://adamhenrycallister.github.io/) shares this interest and so I asked him to collaborate on [Vizlit](https://www.vizlit.com)--a data viz blog project. We each write our own articles and make our own visualizations, but enjoy getting feedback from one another.

My favorite post so far is [S&P Best of Times Worst of Times](https://www.vizlit.com/finance/2020/07/01/sp-performance.html). The post contains an interactive viz I built which allows viewing the historical distribution of returns from the S&P for many different time intervals.

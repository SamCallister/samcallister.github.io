When I was in elementary school there was a reading program where you were required to read a certain number of books. To prove you read a book you had to pass a quiz with questions about that book.

I decided to riff on this memory by making a simple book trivia game. I wrote [a script](https://github.com/SamCallister/book-game/blob/main/src/python/main.py) to programatically pull texts from [project gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/) and generate questions about them.
